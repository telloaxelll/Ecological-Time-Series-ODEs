# Introduction: 
The program that is provided in this repository serves as a guidance for the Applied Mathematics Challenge at
University of California, Merced. 

## Background: 
The Department of Wildlife would like to know how many Bobcats there are in Merced county over the next 90 days. 
They are elusive creatures but you have been tasked with the monumental task of coming up with an accurate estimate of their
population based on observed sightings of Bobcat and Cottontail rabbits, their favorite food. 
If there are too many Bobcats (exceeding >200 in the area), then certain wildlife control may be needed... 

# Mathematical Challenge: 
Come up with a model for the population of bobcats and rabbits in time using the observed time 
series data and predict their populations over the next 90 days!

# Problem Setup: 
In order to tackle this problem, our team has gone ahead and deviced a plan to implement the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system utilizing ODEs to simulate and predict populations based off the datasets for both rabbit and bobcat populations.
